# Introduction

With the HomeWizard Energy platform, you can get insights in your energy usage. Use the HomeWizard [Wi-Fi P1 meter](https://www.homewizard.nl/p1-meter) to access real-time data directly from your smart meter, the HomeWizard [Wi-Fi Energy Socket](https://www.homewizard.nl/energy-socket) to get energy insights from all your devices, the HomeWizard [Wi-Fi kWh Meter](https://www.homewizard.nl/kwh-meter) to measure devices such as solar panels and the HomeWizard [Wi-Fi Watermeter](https://www.homewizard.com/nl/watermeter) to get insight in your water usage. With the open API you can integrate the data directly into your system of choice.

## HomeWizard Energy API

The HomeWizard Wi-Fi P1 meter, Wi-Fi Energy Socket, Wi-Fi kWh meter and Wi-Fi Watermeter ('device') have a local API to retrieve the most recent measurements or control the device. You can access this API as long as you are connected to the same (Wi-Fi) network as the device and the API is enabled in the HomeWizard Energy app. This API is intended to connect your device to your own automation, home automation or graphing system. It is not possible to retrieve data history with the local API, as this is not stored on the device itself.

## Terms and conditions
